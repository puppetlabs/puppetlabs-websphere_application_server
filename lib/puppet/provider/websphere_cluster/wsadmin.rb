# Provider for managing WebSphere clusters via 'wsadmin'
#
# This thing needs some love - some Ruby refinement.
# Basically, the user-provided attribute values determine what command to use
# via the profile_base.  The 'wsadmin' command to use depends on what profile
# we're working with, and a system can have several profiles.
#
# This provider should just handle the creating and removal of clusters.
